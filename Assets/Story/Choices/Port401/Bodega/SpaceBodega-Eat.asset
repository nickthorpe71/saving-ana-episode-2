  dialog: Below the counter where the shop keep is muttering to himself you see a
    package labeled \"Rocket Bar\". You place it on the counter. The man turns and
    looks at you saying \"Just take it! You aren't Kid anyway so I couldn't take
    the money from you even if you do give it to me using her hands!\" As disturbing
    as this is, you are very hungry. You remove the wrapping and take a bite. The
    flavor is creamy and sweet but the high sugar content hurts your molars.
