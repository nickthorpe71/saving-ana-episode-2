  description: a cigarette
  hasDialog: 1
  dialog: You have a strange desire to smoke. The man behind the counter gives you
    a confused look and hurls a pack of cigarettes at you, then watches you closely
    as if waiting for you to do something. You take a cigarette out of the pack and
    place it in your mouth. Reaching in your pocket you find a lighter. You spark
    up the coffin nail and inhale deeply. The earthy sweet taste gives your body
    relief, relaxing your muscles and mind.
