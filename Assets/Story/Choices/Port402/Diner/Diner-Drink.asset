  dialog: "You sit at a table. A minute later  a waiter comes by and pours you a
    cup of coffee. They pour it to the brim leaving no room for cream or sugar, luckily
    you like it black... \n\nYou think of a poem but have nothing to write with.
    You simply enjoy the moment and let it slip out of mind.\n\nVigorous elixir,
    whose robust body steams\nBeneath the diner lamps, all worship thee;\nFor yours
    alone gives life, it seems\nThe inevitable end draws near."
