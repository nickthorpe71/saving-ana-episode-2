    guy standing around the dock of this port, hopefully that helps. Anyway, I''m
    only going to be here to give you helpful tips for a few weeks.  I''m heading
    out with a crew to explore a world on the outer rim. A lot oof ships have been
    crashing there so we want to go investigate." You smile and a voice from within
