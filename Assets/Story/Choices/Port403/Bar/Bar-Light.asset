  dialog: You flip a bent cigarette, the last one in your pack, into your mouth.
    Reaching down you realize your lighter has been replaced by a hole in your pocket.
    You turn and ask the person beside you for a light. As they provide you with
    a flame they whisper "Life is a series of natural and spontaneous changes."
