  text: 'You confront Jer Banta...


    "Hey, I don''t know if you think you are
    doing the right thing, or if you''re in this for the money, or if you are just
    playing along. But, I''ve never understood how peoples words and wallets can
    turn hundreds agains an innocent man just trying to feed his family."


    "Chase
    me if you want"


    He steps back.


    "But If I get caught, it''ll be worse
    than death knowing my daughter starves while I rot in prison."


    Jer Banta
    turns and runs toward a ship!'
