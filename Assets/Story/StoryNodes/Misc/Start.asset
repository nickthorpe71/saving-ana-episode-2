  text: You wake up to see a man standing by a light post. It appears you are on
    some kind wooden paltform. "Hey Kid what the hell just happened??" You sit on
    the ground still stunned. "We were talking about your next target and all of
    a sudden you collapsed like an invisible refridgerator unit fell on your head."
    Your body feels different, you are in a place you have never seen before and
    you have never met the man in front of you...
